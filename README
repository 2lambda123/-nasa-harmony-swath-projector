## Data Services Reprojection Service for SWOT Swath Data

To download source code:

```bash
git clone https://git.earthdata.nasa.gov/scm/sitc/swotrepr.git swotrepr
```

To build the Docker image:

```bash
cd swotrepr
./bin/build-image
```

### Development notes:

SwotRepr runs within a Docker container (both the project itself, and the tests
that are run for CI/CD. If you add a new Python package to be used within
SwotRepr (or remove a third party package), the change in dependencies will need
to be recorded in the relevant requirements file:

* `swotrepr/conda_requirements.txt`: Requirements needed for SwotRepr to run,
	obtained from the `conda-forge` channel.
* `swotrepr/pip_requirements.txt`: Additional requirements installed within
	the container's conda environment via Pip. These are also required for the
	source code of SwotRepr to run.
* `swotrepr/test/pip_test_requirements.txt`: Requirements only used while running
	tests, such as `pylint` or `coverage`. These are kept separate to reduce the
	dependencies in the delivered software.

### Running tests:

SwotRepr has Python tests that use the `unittest` package. These can be run
within a Docker container using the following two scripts:

```bash
./bin/build-test
./bin/run-test /full/path/to/swotrepr-coverage
```
Coverage reports are being generate for each build in Bamboo, and saved as artifacts.

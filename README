Data Services Reprojection Service for SWOT Swatch Data

To download source code:

> git clone https://git.earthdata.nasa.gov/scm/sitc/swotrepr.git swotrepr

To build the Docker image:

> cd swotrepr

> ./bin/build-image

The image build process needs Earthdata Login credentials to access the Harmony utility library. The
script will attempt to retrieve credentials from a '.netrc' file, but will prompt you for credentials
if it cannot find any. These credentials are used ONLY during the build process, and will not be
propagated or otherwise stored in the docker image.

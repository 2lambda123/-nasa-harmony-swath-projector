# Build the image
# This command tags the image with two tags:
# - The one supplied as a script argument. Bamboo will provide the semantic
#   version number from `docker/service_version.txt`.
# - "latest", so the test Dockerfile can use the service image as a base image.
#
docker build -t ${image}:${tag} -t ${image}:latest -f docker/service.Dockerfile .
